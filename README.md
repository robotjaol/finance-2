# robotjaol | Finance: Personal and Executive Financial Management Web Application

## Project Overview

`robotjaol | Finance` is envisioned as a highly responsive, sleek, and futuristic web application designed for comprehensive personal and executive financial management. The application aims to provide an immersive and data-rich experience, comparable to elite fintech dashboards, by combining elegant minimalism with high interactivity, real-time updates, and ultra-smooth performance. A key architectural decision is its full offline capability after initial load, relying on client-side storage mechanisms such as `localStorage`, `IndexedDB`, local JSON files, or optionally `SQLite` for all user data and authentication details, thereby avoiding complex backend infrastructures.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
*   **Framework:** Next.js (or optionally Astro with React for flexibility)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with support from shadcn/ui or Radix UI for accessible and consistent UI components.
*   **Icons:** lucide-react or Heroicons.
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion for subtle yet elegant transitions and interactions.
*   **State Management:** Zustand or React Context for managing application state, with optional persistence for session recovery.
*   **Notifications:** react-toastify or sonner for real-time feedback.
*   **Data Visualization:** Recharts, Chart.js, or lightweight D3 integrations for interactive graphs and charts. Optional integration of lightweight TradingView-style widgets.
*   **3D Visualization:** Three.js, react-three-fiber, or reactbits.dev for the immersive Visualizer tab.

### Backend (Client-side Emulation):
*   **Data Storage:** localStorage, IndexedDB, local JSON files, or SQLite (browser-based) for secure, offline data persistence.
*   **Authentication:** Local username-password interface with SHA-256 hashing for credential security.

### Development & Deployment:
*   **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier for consistent code formatting.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel for one-click deployment, configured via `vercel.json`.
*   **Testing (Optional):** Vitest or Jest for unit testing, ensuring long-term scalability.

## Key Features

The application will feature a multi-tabbed modular dashboard interface, with each tab representing a distinct functional pillar of financial management:

1.  **Overview:** High-level summary of total balance, net cash flow, upcoming bills, and recent activity.
2.  **Transactions:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for income and expenses, including tagging, filtering, and file attachments. Transactions will be formatted in Indonesian Rupiah (Rp) using `Intl.NumberFormat('id-ID')`.
3.  **Budgeting:** Users can define category-specific budgets, monitor usage in real-time, and receive alerts upon nearing spending limits. Animated progress indicators will visualize remaining amounts.
4.  **Reports & Insights:** Intelligent analytics through static and animated infographics, AI-powered recommendations, and historical comparisons. Includes real-time line graphs, bar charts, candlestick-like charts, and interactive pie charts.
5.  **Goals:** Users can define and track savings objectives with visual goal trackers, expected completion timelines, and automatic budget allocation suggestions.
6.  **Top Management Panel:** A control center for executive users, offering cross-year comparisons, scenario modeling (e.g., “What if my salary increases by 15%?”), and aggregated summaries. Includes a “Financial Health Score” calculation.
7.  **Export & Documents:** Supports data exports in `.xlsx`, `.csv`, and `.pdf` formats. Monthly report generation, backups, and data import/export via `.json` files.
8.  **Settings:** For managing user preferences such as language, currency format, themes (dark/light mode toggle), and user roles.
9.  **Simulation:** A sandbox for creating “what-if” financial scenarios.
10. **Visualizer:** An immersive 3D environment powered by Three.js, react-three-fiber, or reactbits.dev, visualizing cashflow as flowing particles or waves.

## UI/UX Principles

*   **Responsiveness:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
*   **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind, leveraging shadcn/ui or Radix UI.
*   **Theming:** Default dark mode with toggle support for light theme.
*   **Animations:** Subtle yet elegant animations for component transitions, chart animations, and feedback interactions.

## Project Architecture & Code Quality

*   **Modular Structure:** Clean project architecture with dedicated folders for `/components`, `/pages`, `/hooks`, `/lib`, `/context`, `/stores`, and `/data`.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Lazy loading and dynamic imports for charts and animations.
*   **Code Standards:** Enforced with ESLint + Prettier.
*   **Deployment Ready:** Includes `vercel.json` for streamlined Vercel deployment.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive `README.md` with installation instructions, developer guidance, and deployment steps.

This project aims to deliver a delightful, powerful, and data-rich experience, blending aesthetics and intelligence to empower users in managing their financial journey.



## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd robotjaol-finance
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Then, install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
